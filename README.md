# mongoose-findorcreate

A plugin for Mongoose which adds the findOrCreate method to models. The method will either append an existing object or save a new one, depending on wether it finds it or not. There is already a [`mongoose-findorcreate` plugin](https://github.com/drudge/mongoose-findorcreate), but it has not been maintained, and the author does not respond to issues or PRs.
